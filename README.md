## 💡 Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of airport flights, passengers, and revenue to uncover operational patterns, identify high-performing airports, and explore correlations between key metrics. It emphasizes clarity and visual storytelling through clean analytics workflows. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## ✅ Features
- 📈 Compute **total flights**, **passenger counts**, and **revenue** per airport  
- 📊 Generate **bar charts** for flights, passengers, and revenue by airport  
- 🔄 Create a **correlation heatmap** to examine relationships between metrics  
- 🧹 Handle missing data, summary statistics, and data cleaning steps  
- 📝 Includes Jupyter notebook for exploratory analysis

---

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **`airport_flights.csv`** – Contains:
  - `Airport` (name), `Number of Flights`, `Number of Passengers`, and `Amount` (revenue) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Requirements
- **Python 3.7+**  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- Jupyter notebook for interactive data exploration

---

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MisaghMomeniB/Airport-Flight-Analysis.git
cd Airport-Flight-Analysis
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
````

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open and run `analysis.py` or the included notebook.
3. Explore insights, charts, and summary tables.

* **analysis.py** mirrors the Jupyter notebook, containing:

  * Data load & cleaning
  * Summary stats & null checks
  * Bar charts and correlation heatmap visualizations ([reddit.com][1], [github.com][2], [github.com][3])

---

## 📊 Key Insights

* Identification of airports with **highest flight counts**, \*\* passenger numbers\*\*, and **revenue**
* Visualization of differences across airports via **bar charts**
* Discovery of strong correlations between flights, passengers, and revenue using a **heatmap**

---

## ⚡ Future Enhancements

* 📅 Add **time-series analysis** over months or years
* 🌐 Integrate additional metrics like **on-time performance**, **delays**, or **latency**
* 📈 Apply **clustering** or **regression** to identify patterns or predict revenue
* 📋 Create interactive dashboards with **Plotly** or **Streamlit**
